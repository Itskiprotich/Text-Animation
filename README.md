## Add dependency

Add this in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}		
```
Add this in your app level gradle:

```
implementation 'com.github.sarnavakonar:TextWriter:v1.0'
```

## Initialization

Add TextWriter in your xml file:

```
<com.sarnava.textwriter.TextWriter
        android:id="@+id/textWriter"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

Initialize in the Activity file:

```
TextWriter textWriter;

textWriter = findViewById(R.id.textWriter);
```

## Customization

Customize according to your need (**as of now it supports only uppercase letters and whitespace** :broken_heart:):

```
textWriter
         .setWidth(12)
         .setDelay(30)
         .setColor(Color.RED)
         .setConfig(TextWriter.Configuration.INTERMEDIATE)
         .setSizeFactor(30f) 
         .setLetterSpacing(25f)
         .setText("LIVERPOOL FC")
         .setListener(new TextWriter.Listener() {
          	@Override
          	public void WritingFinished() {

			//do stuff after animation is finished
                }
          })
         .startAnimation();
```
***Because of different screen resolutions of different devices, try to avoid using constant values for width, sizeFactor and letterSpacing. Instead use some fraction of the screenWidth for consistent result across multiple devices.***
